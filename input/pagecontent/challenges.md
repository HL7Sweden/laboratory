### Terminology

As in other care areas, the adoption of different terminologies is one of the interoperability challenges to be faced, with different code systems used and the known issue with the termiinology mapping.

For example, there are two main international laboratory terminology systems that are being used in Europe for **test coding**: 
* Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), and
* Nomenclature for Properties and Units (NPU).

with the exception of UK using SNOMED CT.

The same issue arises with other coded elements as specimen types, anatomic specification, specimen collection, processing and examination techniques, devices, containers, measurement units, and ordinal or nominal-scale test results.

Regularly, test qualitative results are expressed via SNOMED CT concepts, quantitatively measured results are documented by standardised units, which are expressed preferably via UCUM to allow computer processing.  As SNOMED CT is the most extensive terminology in health care, this code system offers solutions for the coded representation of laboratory-related facts in most cases.
