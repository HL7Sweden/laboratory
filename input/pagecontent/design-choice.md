### Terminology systems
Two main international laboratory terminology systems for test coding are being used in Europe: Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) and Nomenclature for Properties and Units (NPU). This represents an interoperability challenge as mapping between those two code systems might be necessary.

It should be noted that additional code systems are needed for coding of specimen types, anatomic specification, specimen collection, processing and examination techniques, devices, containers, measurement units, and ordinal or nominal-scale test results.
Complementary to the coding of laboratory tests, test results are to be documented in a standardised and coded way too. Regularly, test qualitative results are expressed via SNOMED CT concepts, quantitatively measured results are documented by standardised units, which are expressed preferably via UCUM to allow computer processing.  As SNOMED CT is the most extensive terminology in health care, this code system offers solutions for the coded representation of laboratory-related facts in most cases.
